# Stolen from http://shellrunner.com/better-simpler-searching-and-scripting-with-bash-globstar/
    # Globstar is a feature not typically enabled, but present in bash 4+, and it allows you to do more easily select files in bash, using a double star **.
    # For example, if you want to every .text file, in all subdirectories, you no longer even need to use the find command.
    # ls **/*.text
    # The ** here will traverse any number of directories, not just the current directory.  Hereâ€™s another very useful, easy to remember example.  Ever want to find a line of text somewhere in a huge pile of files, but you know some part of the file name?  You can do a recursive grep to easily find it, without some abstruse find command.
    # grep -r needle **/*haystack*
    # To begin using globstar, you need to enable it.  It should be the default, if you ask me, but enabling is simple.  From the terminal, type:
shopt -s globstar
